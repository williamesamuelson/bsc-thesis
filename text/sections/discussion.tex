From \cref{fig:minevsint}, it is clear that the implemented methods produce an accurate result at and away from the exceptional point. The relative distance to the numerical solver is on the order of $10^{-8}$, and with the use of strict tolerances of the numerical solver, this indicates an accurate method. Furthermore, when reducing the tolerances even more, the distance kept lowering, indicating that the numerical solver might be the limiting factor.

Using the calculated generalized eigenvectors, the evolution in the generalized modes given by \cref{eq:dynep}, could be evidenced in \cref{fig:Idiffrho0}. With an initial condition only overlapping the steady state and one other normal eigenvector, a pure exponential decay toward the steady state is seen by the straight lines in the log plot. When including both $\ket{\bar \rho}\rangle$ and $\ket{\rho_3}\rangle$ in the initial condition, the decay first follows the quicker decay channel, then gradually turns into following the decay of $\ket{\bar\rho}\rangle$. Another behavior is seen for the initial condition including $\ket{\rho'}\rangle$. This decay channel is not of exponential nature, since a factor of $te^{\bar\lambda t}$ enters in the decay. 

Something about the similarity of \cref{fig:diffde} to Haak's paper regarding critical damping.

The main takeaways from the implemented methods and the following simulations consist of two parts. Firstly, that the general evolution for the parallel quantum dot system at an EP indeed can be understood in terms of the sum of generalized modes given by \cref{eq:genmode}. This means that the Jordan blocks evolve separately, and that the initial condition decides what modes are involved in the dynamics of the system. Secondly, that the implemented methods give direct access to the generalized eigenvectors through numerical means, which in theory can be done for even larger systems and higher order EPs, unlike algebraic methods. The generalized eigenvectors can then be used as initial conditions, directly controlling what Jordan blocks are included in the evolution.

Applications and further theoretical outlook?
