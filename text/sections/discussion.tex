From figure~\ref{fig:minevsint}, it is clear that the implemented methods produce an accurate result at and away from the exceptional point. The relative distance to the numerical solver is on the order of $10^{-8}$, and with the use of strict tolerances of the numerical solver, this indicates an accurate method. When reducing the tolerances even more, the distance kept lowering, indicating that the numerical solver might be the (?) factor.

However, since the dynamics may just as well be simulated by the numerical solver, the implemented methods are not that interesting of themselves. But by showing that the solution in the form described above,... Two fold
