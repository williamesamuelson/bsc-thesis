A fundamental postulate of quantum mechanics is that the Hamiltonian of a closed system is Hermitian, which guarantees real-valued energies and conserved probabilities throughout the evolution of the system. However, for quantum systems where there is dissipation and crosstalk with the environment, such as a collection of quantum dots connected to metallic leads, the dynamics is instead generated by a non-Hermitian Liouvillian superoperator. One feature of non-Hermitian operators, showing increasing theoretical and experimental interest recently, is the possibility of exceptional points. These are points in parameter space which causes two or more eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors of the operator to simultaneously coalesce. In this thesis, we study a system of two quantum dots coupled in parallel to metallic leads and demonstrate the existence of a second order exceptional point in the Liouvillian superoperator. Furthermore, the dynamics at this exceptional point is analyzed in detail using a combination of analytical and numerical methods, including simulations of the density operator and the current through the system. We show that the dynamics can be understood in terms of generalized modes and that the system exhibits unique algebraic decay at the exceptional point. Furthermore, critical damping at the exceptional point is indicated in the current, in accordance with a previous work on exceptional points in quantum thermal machines.
