abstract = {QmeQ is an open-source Python package for numerical modeling of transport through quantum dot devices with strong electron–electron interactions using various approximate master equation approaches. The package provides a framework for calculating stationary particle or energy currents driven by differences in chemical potentials or temperatures between the leads which are tunnel coupled to the quantum dots. The electronic structures of the quantum dots are described by their single-particle states and the Coulomb matrix elements between the states. When transport is treated perturbatively to lowest order in the tunneling couplings, the possible approaches are Pauli (classical), first-order Redfield, and first-order von Neumann master equations, and a particular form of the Lindblad equation. When all processes involving two-particle excitations in the leads are of interest, the second-order von Neumann approach can be applied. All these approaches are implemented in QmeQ. We here give an overview of the basic structure of the package, give examples of transport calculations, and outline the range of applicability of the different approximate approaches.
Program summary
Program Title: QmeQ Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/8687mrhgg9.1 Licensing provisions: BSD 2-Clause Programming language: Python External libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Cython Nature of problem: Calculation of stationary state currents through quantum dots tunnel coupled to leads. Solution method: Exact diagonalization of the quantum dot Hamiltonian for a given set of single particle states and Coulomb matrix elements. Numerical solution of the stationary-state master equation for a given approximate approach. Restrictions: Depending on the approximate approach the temperature needs to be sufficiently large compared to the coupling strength for the approach to be valid.}

abstract="Physical aspect of the exceptional point in the spectrum of the Liouville-von Neumann operator (Liouvillian) is discussed. The example we study in this paper is the weakly-coupled one-dimensional quantum perfect Lorentz gas. The effective Liouvillian for the system derived by applying the Brillouin-Wigner-Feshbach formalism takes non-Hermitian form due to resonance singularity, thus its spectra take complex values. We find that the complex spectra has two second order exceptional points in the wavenumber space. As a physical effect of the exceptional points, we show that the time evolution of the Wigner distribution function is described by the telegraph equation. The time evolution described by the telegraph equation shows a shifting motion in space. We also show that mechanism of the shifting motion completely changes at the exceptional points.",
